# Build-a-Data-Mart-in-SQL
The program represents a Use-Case of booking a hotel room based on "Airbnb" system.

# Task
Has to be built a database for storing and processing information regarding the Airbnb use case. Therefore, the first step is to develop an entity relationship model (ERM), which describes the single data tables with its attributes and the relations between these entities. This ERM is the basis for developing a database with a state-of-the-art database management system.
Has to be defined a database structure and certain reasonable dummy data, to ensure an appropriate usage of the database and some feasible queries to present the results in a document. Every step and written SQL Statement is being documented. Furthermore, the database has to be normalized in an appropriate way to ensure only necessary data storage.
